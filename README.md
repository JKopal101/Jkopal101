# Hi, I’m James! 👋

### Thanks for stopping by!

This is my space where I explore, learn, and share my journey in Cybersecurity. I’m passionate about tackling complex security challenges through hands-on projects. From analyzing cloud migrations to building a live honeynet and SOC in Azure, I enjoy diving deep into the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity. Right now, I’m focusing on mastering Linux, Python, security automation, threat hunting, and pen testing. I'm also actively working towards certifications like CompTIA Security+ and Network+, with a long-term goal of achieving CISSP.
